## Introduction

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is a space agency that has made significant contributions to space exploration, and satellite technology and has also allowed India's population to access the practical advantages of space.

## Why Choose ISRO?

ISRO's achievements have inspired generations of scientists, engineers, and dreamers. However, the current ISRO website falls short of reflecting the organization's cutting-edge capabilities and fails to effectively engage with its diverse audience.

Revamping the ISRO website presents a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between this pioneering institution and the public it serves. A modern, user-friendly, and informative website can become a powerful tool for education, outreach, and inspiration. By designing a website that puts stakeholders' values at the core while also leveraging the latest web technologies and design principles, we aim to create a digital platform that truly showcases ISRO's missions, research, and impact on society.

## Objectives:

1. Visual Appeal:
   * Incorporate ISRO's signature colors: ISRO blue, ISRO orange, and white.
   * Use high-quality images and videos related to space exploration.
   * Ensure a clean, modern design that resonates with visitors.

2. Enhance accessibility: Ensure that information is easily navigable and comprehensible for visitors of all ages and technical backgrounds.

3. Showcase achievements: Create an immersive experience that highlights ISRO's past successes and ongoing missions through, 3D models, and multimedia content.

4. Optimize for mobile: Ensure a seamless experience across all devices, recognizing the prevalence of mobile internet usage in India.

5. Streamline information dissemination: Create an efficient system for sharing press releases, updates, and scientific findings

## Conclusion:

We hope you enjoy exploring the revamped ISRO website! Feel free to reach out to our team members for any inquiries or feedback.
